    <p class="govuk-body">Google Analytics software collects information about how you use the site. This is done to help make sure the site is
      meeting the needs of its users and to help make improvements.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the pages you visit - how long you spend on each page</li>
      <li>how you got to the site</li>
